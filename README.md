# NoCrop (Legacy)
NoCrop for Twitter
This extension is not under active development. Twitter has released a similar feature to this extension. There is no need for NoCrop anymore.
This is a chromium extension that removes the Twitter crop from images. Get it on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocrop-for-twitter/pdhifmaflfpcpionlfhaphnnkkjajeed) or [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/nocrop-for-twitter/gmkpinkbneacfbjgmeihelcckaokmblb)

## Build Instructions
If you want to build the extension for yourself, you can download the repo. Select all the folders, and compress that to a zip-file. It's that simple
